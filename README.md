locco
======

[Docco](//github.com/jashkenas/docco) port that doesn't depend on
[Pygments](//pygments.org/). It uses
[Github Flavored Markdown](//github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
for Markdown processing and [Highlight.js](//highlightjs.org) for syntax highlight.

Supports template customization using [Mustache](//mustache.github.com).

### Installation

    npm install locco --save

Test
----

    grunt vows

Usage
-----

### locco( pattern, options )

Parses a series of files found using a [`glob`](//github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
pattern. The resulting HTML files are written in
the default `doc` directory.

Here goes an example:

```js
var locco = require("locco");

var documentedFiles = locco("js/**/*.js");
```

The `documentedFiles` variable will be an array containing the parsed files.

> **locco** does everything synchronously. Why is that?
> Because locco is useful in contexts where asynchronicity means nothing
> but troble.
> In **locco**, doc generation for each file is intended to be atomic. Files
> are usually too many for you to be able to handle callbacks without
> serious acrobatics, and with no real benefit, why should you?

#### Options

The second, optional argument allows you to configure both the output folder
and whether the base folder in the glob pattern will be excluded from
the hierarchy in the output files.

##### `output`

Sets the path of the output folder. Default: **doc**

```js
var locco = require("locco");

var documentedFiles = locco("js/**/*.js", {output: "documentation"});
```

##### `includeBase`

If `true`, includes the full relative file path in the folder. If
`false`, includes the path starting from the `**` or `*` wildcards in
the glob pattern, which is more clean.

Default is `false`.

For example, if your project source files are all contained in a `src`
directory, setting the pattern to `src/**/*js`
will produce the files to be output directly into the `doc` directory
discarding the `src` prefix.

```js
var locco = require("locco");

var documentedFiles = locco("src/**/*.js", {includeBase: false});
```

#### Arguments

- `String` pattern
- _optional_ `Object` options
  - output: `String`
  - includeBase: `Boolean`

#### Returns

- `Array` parsedFiles
